VIDEO CONFERENCING WEBSITE
This is the Full Stack Web Development project which is basically a Video Conferencing Website.
This is made by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It is a live video-based meeting between two or more people in different locations using video-enabled devices.
It allows multiple people to meet and collaborate face-to-face over long distances by transmitting audio, video, text, and presentations in real-time through the internet.
